# MonsterEvolving
A game made with Unity where your character is a low level monster that must evolve to get new skills and roles.

Right now I am creating the spells for every character, if you want you can test them with the buttons:

Moving around : arrow keys

Simple attack : a

Fire ball : f

Little waterfall : w
